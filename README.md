This code can be used to calculate the number of "palindrome days" during a time period.

Of course, whether a day is a palindrome depends on the format and assumptions around the date itself. For this exercise, I am using the following format:

January 7th, 2007 = 1707

mdy, no spaces, 2 digit year (even if leading zero), no leading zeroes on month or day.
